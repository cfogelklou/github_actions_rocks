# Build a Cross-Platform Native App (Electron)

Scenario: you need to build a native app. For windows + osx + linux, you need to build on each of these platforms.

The submodule [hello-electron](./hello-electron) is built on the [electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start) template for building electron cross-platform apps.

However, it is simply a template project, and does not, by default, let us build the app for windows/osx/linux

Let's add a workflow to [hello-electron](https://github.com/cfogelklou/hello-electron) 

- Create file called .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Add unit tests
- Add build steps for each platform
- Create artifacts for each platform and upload
