# Cross-Platform build with CMake

Add a workflow to [roughtime_cpp_client](https://github.com/cfogelklou/roughtime_cpp_client)

Roughtime_cpp_client is a small, portable roughtime client, for fetching trusted timestamps remotely.

This project shows building and running unit tests using CMake and CTest on windows, linux, and ubuntu.

We can also show adding a self-hosted instance.
